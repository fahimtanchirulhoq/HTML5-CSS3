      <h1>corona virus</h1>
      <p>Coronaviruses are a group of related RNA viruses that cause diseases
         in mammals and birds. In humans and birds, they cause respiratory tract 
         infections that can range from mild to lethal. Mild illnesses in humans </p>
         <p> include some cases of the common cold (which is also caused by other viruses, 
          predominantly rhinoviruses), while more lethal varieties can cause SARS, MERS and
           COVID-19,</p>
        <p> which is causing the ongoing pandemic. In cows and pigs they cause diarrhea,
           while in mice they cause hepatitis and encephalomyelitis.</p>
