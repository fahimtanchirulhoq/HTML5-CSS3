            <p1> Coronaviruses are large, roughly spherical particles with uniqu
                e surface projections.[43] Their size is highly variable with 
                average diameters of 80 to 120 nm. Extreme sizes are known 
                from 50 to 200 nm in diameter.[44] The total molecular 
                mass is on average 40,000 kDa. They are enclosed in an 
                envelope embedded with a number of protein molecules.[45] 
                The lipid bilayer envelope, membrane proteins, and nucleocapsid
                 protect the virus when it is outside the host cell.[46]</p1>
